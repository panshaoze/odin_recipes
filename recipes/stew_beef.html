    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>1 (2 pound) boneless beef round steak, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>kosher salt and cracked black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh peas</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>3 cups chopped carrots </li>
        <li> 3 cups cubed Yukon Gold potatoes </li>
        
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Place beef cubes into a large bowl. Season with kosher salt and black pepper. Add flour and paprika and toss until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in an oven-safe Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear the beef cubes in batches until dark brown, about 4 minutes per side. Flip or stir gently with a wooden spoon until all edges are dark brown, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove beef and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add onions to the beef fat with more salt and pepper; cook and stir until they begin to caramelize, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and stir until aromatic and soft, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomato paste and cook until it turns brown and begins to caramelize and stick to the bottom of the pan. Deglaze with red wine, scraping up the flavorful browned bits on the bottom. Let the wine reduce until almost dry again, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li> Add dried thyme, dried rosemary, herbes de Provence, and bay leaves. Add 2 cups beef broth and Worcestershire, stir, and bring to a boil. Add the seared beef cubes back into the stew liquid. Remove from heat and cover the pot.        </li>
        <li>Braise in the preheated oven until meat is almost tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven. Add carrots, potatoes, and more beef broth if needed. Cover and return to the oven to braise until meat and vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes longer.</li>
        <li> Serve Hot </li>
